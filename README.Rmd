# Interval-Censored Multi-STATE modelling (icmstate)

Using the \pkg{icmstate} package it is possible to estimate transition intensities in interval-censored multi-state models. The package also provides utilities for plotting panel data and transition probabilities between states. Many of the functions from the \pkg{mstate} package can be used for visualisation as well. The package currently supports two approaches to determine transition intensities, either using the Multinomial likelihood approach as in Gomon \& Putter or the latent Poisson approach as in Gu et al. (2023).





## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("d-gomon/icmstate")
```
